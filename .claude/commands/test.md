# Test Request Command

Create a testing request for AI-based QA testing.

## Instructions

If you haven't read `.claude/docs/TESTING_REQUEST_GUIDE.md` in this session, read it first.

## Task

Create a test request document in `tools/testing/requests/`.

Use a descriptive filename based on what's being tested (e.g., `auth-flow.md`, `deployments-crud.md`, `full-site-exploration.md`).

If a similar request already exists, you can either:
- Edit it to update test cases
- Create a new one with a different name

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS - Description of what to test. Can be a word, sentence, or detailed description. If empty, use current conversation context.
